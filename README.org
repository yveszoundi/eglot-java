* Overview

This package provides additional Java programming language support for [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]].
- Few convenience functions are available for common operations such as creating a new project or class.
- There are couple of customization options , including passing custom JVM arguments to the Eclipse JDT language server.
- The [[https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls][Eclipse JDT Language Server]] is automatically installed (if needed) when you open a Java file: this gives you code completion, refactoring capabilities, etc.

| =eglot-java-project-build-task=    | Run a build task using [[https://gradle.org/][Gradle]] or [[https://maven.apache.org/][Maven]] for the current project          |

* Dependencies

- The only *direct* Emacs package dependency is [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]], assuming you're running a recent Emacs version.
- The [[https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.jdt.ls/downloads][Eclipse JDT Language server]] along with the [[https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.platform/junit-platform-console-standalone][JUnit console runner]] are configured to be *automatically installed* when not found at default locations (see =M-x customize-group= /eglot-java/).
  - The Eclipse JDT.LS team mentions that there's support for [[https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls#features][compiling projects from Java 1.5 through 16]], but you're encouraged to use recent versions of the Java Development Toolkit ([[https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/][JDK]]).
  - This extension has been tested with recent Java and Eclipse JDT snapshot versions for few years (since roughly mid-2018).
- Please also configure your *[[https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html][PATH]]* environment variable [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_environment_setup.htm][for Maven]] and/or [[https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html][for Gradle]]. Gradle LSP support doesn't seem that mature compared to Maven overall (LSP server errors or other intermittent issues).

* Installation

The =eglot-java= package is available on [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA]].

Once the MELPA repository is configured, please run =M-x package-install= and type =eglot-java=.

* Usage

** Customization

You can configure few settings to reflect your preferences via =M-x customize-group= (/eglot-java/):
- You can set the default LSP server installation folder, etc.
- You can specify JVM arguments for the LSP server (=eglot-java-eclipse-jdt-args= variable).
- etc.

** Configuration

*** Initialization

Below is a sample minimal configuration, without any fancy library such as =use-package= or similar.

#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'eglot-java-mode)
  (add-hook 'eglot-java-mode-hook (lambda ()                                        
    (define-key eglot-java-mode-map (kbd "C-c l n") #'eglot-java-file-new)
    (define-key eglot-java-mode-map (kbd "C-c l x") #'eglot-java-run-main)
    (define-key eglot-java-mode-map (kbd "C-c l t") #'eglot-java-run-test)
    (define-key eglot-java-mode-map (kbd "C-c l N") #'eglot-java-project-new)
    (define-key eglot-java-mode-map (kbd "C-c l T") #'eglot-java-project-build-task)
    (define-key eglot-java-mode-map (kbd "C-c l R") #'eglot-java-project-build-refresh)))
#+end_src

* Other notes for Gradle projects

If you have issues with [[https://gradle.org/][Gradle projects]] (code completion not working), then it's likely due to [[https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html][version incompatibilities]] (JDK and bundled Gradle Eclipse versions):
- The safe approach is to always rely on the Gradle wrapper, accordingly to the [[https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html][Gradle compatibility matrix]]
- As of December 2022, the latest Eclipse JDT LS would include the [[https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls/blob/master/org.eclipse.jdt.ls.target/org.eclipse.jdt.ls.tp.target#L14][buildship plugin version 3.17.x]] for Gradle support
- For version =3.17.x= that [[https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/blob/master/org.gradle.toolingapi/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF][translates into Gradle 7.4.2 or later]]
- =Gradle 7.4.2= would not be compatible with let's say =JDK 19=, the user would need [[https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html][Gradle 7.6]], thus why it's best to always use/generate the Gradle wrapper for peace of mind

* Contributing

All the bugs reports are welcome and appreciated.
- *Please note that the best way to contribute is via pull requests*.
- I may not notice immediately when something is broken, as I don't really write that much Java code anymore.
